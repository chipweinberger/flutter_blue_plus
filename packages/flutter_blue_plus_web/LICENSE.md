FlutterBluePlus License
Version 1.2

### Preamble (Non-Binding)

The intent of this license is to make FlutterBluePlus ("The Software") as free and open as possible for personal users, researchers, nonprofits, educational institutions, and hobbyists. For these users, the terms are similar to the BSD license: broad freedom to use, modify, and share.

For any use by a for-profit organization — including commercial use by an individual, a commercial license is required.

The revenue from commercial licenses supports the long-term maintenance and development of FlutterBluePlus.
This approach allows individuals, small companies, nonprofits, and educators to benefit from free and open software, while ensuring that larger companies who rely on it help sustain its future.

Please be aware that this project originated under the BSD-3 license, and some portions of the codebase remain under that license today. Compliance with those clauses is not required under the FlutterBluePlus License itself, but to remain fully compliant with the terms set by those contributors, it is advised that users continue to follow the BSD-3 conditions described in NOTICE.md. That relationship is between you and the BSD-licensed contributors.

This preamble is provided for explanation only and does not form part of the binding legal terms of this license.

### Section 3: Commercial Terms (for for-profit organizations)

Any use of FlutterBluePlus by or for a for-profit company or corporation — including commercial use by individuals — requires the purchase of a commercial license, subject to the Common Conditions and the following additional terms:

**1. License Fee.** Commercial licenses are offered in the following tiers, based on employee count **at the time of purchase or renewal**. The associated cost is listed on the official FlutterBluePlus payment portal.

- **Starter:** 0–9 employees  
- **Team:** 10–29 employees  
- **Business:** 30–99 employees  
- **Enterprise:** 100 or more employees  

**2. Perpetual Use.** The license grants perpetual rights to use the Software as it exists at the time of purchase and includes any versions received during the update and bug-fix entitlement period.

**3. Updates and Bug Fixes.** The license also entitles the licensee to updates and bug fixes for a period of two years (730 days) starting from when the Software is **first commercially shipped or publicly released** by the licensee.

**4. Renewals.** Continued access to updates beyond this period requires purchasing a new commercial license.

**5. Development Clarification.** Use of the Software by a for-profit organization during development or testing **is considered commercial use** and requires a commercial license; however, access to updates and bug fixes begins only once a product incorporating the Software is first commercially shipped or publicly released, as governed by Section 3.3.

**6. Official Payment Portal.** Payment must be made via the official payment portal: https://jamcorder.myshopify.com/products/flutterblueplus-commercial-license

**7. Validity of Offer.** This Section constitutes an offer only while this license version is the current version published in the main branch of the official FlutterBluePlus repository. Once superseded, replaced, or withdrawn, this version shall no longer be considered an active offer, even if archived copies remain publicly visible.


A valid commercial license covers use of all current and future packages that
are part of the FlutterBluePlus project, including its federated packages
(e.g., flutter_blue_plus, flutter_blue_plus_darwin, flutter_blue_plus_android,
flutter_blue_plus_web, flutter_blue_plus_linux, flutter_blue_plus_platform_interface).
Only a single commercial license is required per organization, regardless of how many
FlutterBluePlus packages are used.
