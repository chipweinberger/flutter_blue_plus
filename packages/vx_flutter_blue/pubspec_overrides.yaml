# pubspec_overrides.yaml
# These overrides only apply locally when you run `flutter pub get` in this app.
# They replace the normal pub.dev versions with your local paths for local development.
# The overrides are ignored when publishing packages to pub.dev and will not be
# included in releases. Safe to keep around for local iteration.
#
# Use this to work on vx_flutter_blue and its platform packages without editing
# pubspec.yaml every time.
