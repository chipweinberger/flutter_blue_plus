### Preamble (Non-Binding)

The intent of this license is to make FlutterBluePlus ("The Software") as free and open as possible for small organizations, individual developers, researchers, nonprofits, educational institutions, and hobbyists.  
For these users, the terms are similar to the BSD license: broad freedom to use, modify, and share.  

For larger for-profit organizations with fifty (50) or more employees worldwide, this license requires the purchase of a commercial license.  

The revenue from commercial licenses supports the long-term maintenance and development of FlutterBluePlus.  
This approach allows individuals, small companies, nonprofits, and educators to benefit from free and open software, while ensuring that larger companies who rely on it help sustain its future.  

Please be aware that this project originated under the BSD-3 license, and some portions of the codebase remain under that license today. Compliance with those clauses is not required under the FlutterBluePlus License itself, but to remain fully compliant with the terms set by those contributors, it is advised that users continue to follow the BSD-3 conditions described in NOTICE.md. That relationship is between you and the BSD-licensed contributors.

This preamble is provided for explanation only and does not form part of the binding legal terms of this license.
